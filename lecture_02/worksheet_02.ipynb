    "At times, the top down approach can be a little time consuming as you need to break down the problem into different parts. Testing and it's modifiability will be difficult if you did not keep that in mind when building the solution. In this case, nothing that can be executed exists until late in programming, which is what makes testing a burden."

    "3. Sanity check then try looking online for some help, generally someone else has probably come across the same problem you have and with online fourms you can usually solve the issue."
